# HandyUI
We turn fancy UI designs into reality with the help of HandyControl Power.

We use [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) designs

---
**NOTE**

- To see the designs better, please run the program in full screen mode (Display Resolution 1920 X 1080)
- The designs are created statically and are not dynamic. We may create it dynamically in the future. This is not a difficult task, it just takes more time.
- The created user interface is suitable for Full-Screen mode
- Some user interfaces are not responsive
- Some user interfaces are compatible with dark and light themes, some are not
- Some user interfaces are designed specifically for dark or light themes (So if the design is not very interesting, activate the dark theme)
